# Carrier - Anopheles-arabiensis-Dongola_PEPTIDES_AaraD1.3.fa
# Non-Carrier1 - Anopheles-quadriannulatus-SANGQUA_PEPTIDES.AquaS1.3.fa
# Non_carrier2 - Anopheles-christyi-ACHKN1017_PEPTIDES_AchrA1.3.fa

## Steps: 
# Part 1: 
# * research for proteins which have been found to possibly do with malaria
# * record these genes into a fasta document

# Part 2: 
# * compare these proteins to non-carrier 1 and record any which are under 85% seq ID
# * compare the canadites to non-carrier 2 and record any again under 85% seq ID

# Part 3: 
# * compare top canadaties to 3 carrier proteomes and determine highest scoring protein

# Part 4: 
# * align this gene with all carriers and create a sequence Logo





## Steps: 
# Part 1: 
# * align genes from carrier with ones from Non-carrier and record genes that are under 85% seq identity 
# * align the 85% seq idenetiy genes with ones from non-carrier 2 and record those which are also under 85%

# Part 2: 
# * algin the most proment genes with 3 other carriers and determine the best match with those

# Part 3: 
# * Algin the best gene with the rest of the mosquito proteins and find best match from all 
# * parform multip seq alignment and create logos
